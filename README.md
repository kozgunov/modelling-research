DeepSight: Advanced Object Detection in Maritime Environments
Project Overview
DeepSight leverages the power of YOLOv8n deep learning model to detect and classify objects on water surfaces. This project is aimed at enhancing maritime safety and navigation by providing real-time analysis of the maritime environment through state-of-the-art computer vision techniques.

Objectives
Object Detection: Automatically detect various objects such as buoys, vessels, and navigational markers.
Real-Time Processing: Analyze images in real-time to provide immediate feedback and alerts.
Enhanced Accuracy: Utilize the YOLOv8n model to ensure high accuracy in object recognition under various environmental conditions.
Model Information
This project uses the YOLOv8n model, known for its efficiency and accuracy in object detection tasks. The model has been trained to identify five specific classes:

Buoy
Number
Model with number
Model without number
Trail after the model
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project environment and run the application:

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
PyTorch 1.7 or higher
CUDA Toolkit 12.4 (Ensure that your GPU is compatible with CUDA 12.4)
torchvision, PIL, numpy, matplotlib
Setting Up Your Environment
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourgithub/deepsight.git
cd deepsight
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up CUDA (if not already installed): Make sure CUDA is installed and properly configured as per your system requirements.

Usage
To run the model and start detecting objects on your maritime images, execute:

bash
Copy code
python analyze_image.py --input_dir /path/to/your/images --output_dir /path/to/save/results
Replace /path/to/your/images and /path/to/save/results with your actual directories.

How It Works
Images are processed in real-time using the pre-trained YOLOv8n model.
The system identifies and classifies objects, drawing bounding boxes and labels on the detected items.
Results are saved in the specified output directory, which can be used for further analysis or reporting.

DeepSight: Advanced Object Detection in Maritime Environments

Project Overview

DeepSight is a machine learning project that leverages YOLOv8n, a powerful object detection model, for analyzing maritime environments. The goal of this project is to identify and classify objects such as buoys, vessel numbers, models with numbers, models without numbers, and trails left by vessels. This solution aims to enhance maritime safety by providing real-time insights using computer vision techniques.

Features

Object Detection: Detects and classifies 5 different classes related to maritime objects.

Real-Time Analysis: Capable of analyzing images in real-time for immediate feedback.

Training and Customization: Includes training scripts for customizing the model with new data.

Deployment Ready: Can be deployed using Flask, Docker, or cloud services for real-time inference.

Classes Detected

Buoy

Number

Model with number

Model without number

Trail after the model

Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher

PyTorch 1.7 or higher

CUDA Toolkit 12.4 (optional, if using GPU)

torchvision, PIL, numpy, matplotlib

Setting Up the Environment

Clone the repository:

Install required libraries:

Set up CUDA (if available):
Ensure that CUDA is installed and properly configured for GPU acceleration.

Usage

Training the Model

To train the model and save checkpoints after each epoch:

This command will train the model using the specified training data and save checkpoints to the provided directory.

Analyzing an Image

To analyze a single image and visualize detections:

The command will analyze the provided image and display detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

Processing and Saving Multiple Images

To process a folder of images and save the results to an output directory:

This command will iterate over all images in the input directory, analyze them, and save the output images with detected objects to the output directory.

Deployment

Local Deployment Using Flask

To deploy the model as an API for real-time inference using Flask:

This will start a Flask server where you can POST images for detection at /predict.

Docker Deployment

You can package the application into a Docker container for easy deployment:

Build Docker Image:

Run the Docker Container:

Cloud Deployment

Deploy the model using cloud services such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalability and reliability. Recommended options include:

AWS EC2 for persistent servers.

AWS Lambda for serverless, on-demand inference.

Potential Improvements

Data Augmentation: Improve model robustness with more data augmentation techniques like random flips, rotations, and color adjustments.

Hyperparameter Optimization: Use tools like Optuna to optimize learning rates, batch sizes, and other hyperparameters.

Model Ensembling: Use multiple models to increase accuracy and robustness in predictions.

API Integration: Implement RESTful APIs using Flask or FastAPI for easy integration into other systems.
