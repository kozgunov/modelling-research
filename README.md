# DeepSight: Advanced Real-Time Object Detection in Maritime Environments

DeepSight is a machine learning project that leverages YOLOv8n, a powerful object detection model, for analyzing maritime environments. The goal of this project is to identify and classify objects such as buoys, vessel numbers, models with numbers, models without numbers, and trails left by vessels. This solution aims to enhance maritime safety by providing real-time insights using computer vision techniques.

## Introduction

DeepSight is a machine learning project that leverages YOLOv8n, a powerful object detection model, for analyzing maritime environments. The goal of this project is to identify and classify objects such as buoys, vessel numbers, models with numbers, models without numbers, and trails left by vessels. This solution aims to enhance maritime safety by providing real-time insights using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detects and classifies 5 different classes related to maritime objects.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Capable of analyzing images in real-time for immediate feedback.
- **Training and Customization**: Includes training scripts for customizing the model with new data.
- **Deployment Ready**: Can be deployed using Flask, Docker, or cloud services for real-time inference.
- **Mobility Deployment**: Model can be deployed in the modile phone on in another.

## 5 Classes Detected

- Buoy
- Number
- Model with number
- Model without number
- Trail after the model

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyTorch**: For implementing and training the LLM.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Multiprocessing**: To simulate parallel operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For utility functions and metrics.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting results.
- **Optuna**: For hyperparameter optimization.
- **Yolov8**: Pre-trained model for detecting & post-training.


### Installation

   ```

## Usage

### Running the Simulation

Execute the main script to run the simulation:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Data Preparation

- **Dataset**: Gathering of dataset is done by myself and not published anywhere. it consists from 7'500 photos for post-training.

# Components Description

## Performance Metrics

The system evaluates the global model using multiple performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: later...
- **Perplexity**: later...
- **F1 Score**: later...

## Cloud Deployment

Deploy the model using cloud services such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalability and reliability. Recommended options include:

- **AWS EC2** for persistent servers.
- **AWS Lambda** for serverless, on-demand inference.

## Results and Evaluation
